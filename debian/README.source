The multipath-tools upstream project is slow at cutting off releases. Hence, we periodically checkout the sources from their repository, it this case, from the git repository.

The following example command was used to checkout the sources:
git archive --format=tar.gz --prefix=multipath-tools-0.4.9+git0.9c3c5172/ 9c3c5172 > /tmp/multipath-tools-0.4.9+git0.9c3c5172.tar.gz
