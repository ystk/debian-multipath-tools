multipath-tools (0.4.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  udev, which provides scsi_id, moved the binary to /lib/udev.
  The old name will stop working in the future.
  
  The default config now uses /lib/udev/scsi_id. And you have to
  update /etc/multipath.conf by hand to reflect the new location.

multipath-tools (0.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version removes creation of devices via udev in /dev. All
  device-mapper devices are created by libdevmapper in /dev/mapper.

  To readd the creation of devices in /dev, add the following line to
  the udev rules (e.g. /etc/udev/rules.d/multipath.rules):
  KERNEL=="dm-[0-9]*", PROGRAM="/sbin/devmap_name %M %m", NAME="%k", SYMLINK="%c", OPTIONS+="last_rule"
