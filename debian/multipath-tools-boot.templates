_Description: The location of the getuid callout has changed
 Your /etc/multipath.conf still has a getuid_callout pointing to /sbin/scsi_id
 but the binary has moved to /lib/udev/scsi_id in udev 0.113-1. Please update
 your configuration. This is best done by removing the getuid_callout option
 entirely.
 .
 Don't forget to update your initramfs after these changes. Otherwise your
 system might not boot from multipath.
